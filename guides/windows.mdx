## Overview

Windows is currently very experimental on our virtual server infrastructure. We do not provide licensing and we can only provide very surface-level support for any Windows-based operating systems. By default, it is possible to activate a 180-day evaluation edition for the purposes of evaluating Windows Server. Once the 180-day evaluation is expired, your server will automatically restart every 1 hour.

If you have a dedicated server or a product that is not a virtual server, please open a ticket for assistance as this guide may not help you, since dedicated servers are based on a completely different infrastructure.
